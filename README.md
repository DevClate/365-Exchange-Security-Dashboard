# 365-Exchange-Security-Dashboard

A simple Excel Dashboard for Exchange Security to give you a quick view into the main data points from Exchange Security. These data points are all in the the exchange portal, but they are all seperated out. Also between 90-180 days depending on the data point, the data is removed so there is no long term reporting.

## Current Status

I have created the functions for 365 Security Dashboard v1 and working on the design of the dashboard.
